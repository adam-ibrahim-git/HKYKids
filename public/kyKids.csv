whatToDo,What do I do?,,,,Boyle,,,,,,,,,,,"It is hard to face a concern about your child's development. Thank you for taking this first step! The great news is there are LOTS of resources in our community for folks who have the same concerns as you. If you think there could be a problem with the way your child plays, learns, speaks, acts, or moves, talk to your child's doctor and share your concerns. Depending on your child's age, contact First Steps (ages 0-3) or your local school district (ages 3-6) for assistance at no cost to you. Another excellent resource is Kids Can Do in Danville, which provides occupational, physical and speech/language therapy as well as specialized picky eating/problem feeding, infant positioning and breastfeeding support. Bottom line: If you suspect an issue, don't wait! Acting early can make a real difference.",,,
